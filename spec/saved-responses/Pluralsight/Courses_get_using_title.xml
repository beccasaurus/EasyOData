  <title type="text">Agile Team Practices with Scrum</title>
  <summary type="text">
		This course is much different than most of the other courses in the Pluralsight On-Demand! library. 
		As a course focused purely on software methodology and team processes, it doesn't contain any coding demos or samples for download.
		In classroom environments, this material is complimented with lost of discussion, what-if scenarios, and group exercises.
		This course is a great way to introduce Agile Software Development practices to your team or organization. 
		In addition to learning Scrum, students learn effective techniques for managing Agile teams and projects.
		Students and teams come away with a solid foundation to begin executing their first Scrum Sprint.
		This online material is offered here primarily as reference material for customers who have already taken the instructor-led version of this course.
		To dramatically improve your team's Agility, consider booking an instructor-led course that provides the ideal experience to help you deliver software 
		iteratively and incrementally.
